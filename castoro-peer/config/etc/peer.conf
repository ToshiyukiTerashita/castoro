# Hostname
#
# HostnameForClient defines a hostname of this machine to which clients 
# will access. If HostnameForClient is not specified, it will be determined 
# in the following fashion:
# ruby -e "require 'socket'; p Socket::gethostname"
# HostnameForClient

#
# Network
#
# If MulticastNetwork is specified but MulticastIf is not specified, 
# multicast interface address will be determined by the following steps:
#  1. Gather interface addresses of all network devices on the machine
#  2. Choose one of the interface addresses which is included in the 
#     network address given as MulticastNetwork
#
# If MulticastIf is assigned, it will be used and as a multicast interface
# address and MulticastNetwork will be ignored.
#
# If neither MulticastIf nor MulticastNetwork is specified, a interface 
# address for multicast will be determined in the following way:
# ruby -e "require 'socket'; p IPSocket::getaddress(Socket::gethostname)"

# Multicast address on which every components will be communicating each other
MulticastAddress           239.192.1.1

# A network address on which UDP multicast packets will be sent and received.
# This parameter could be specifed in prefix/subnet mask or CIDR notiation.
# Examples:
#   192.168.1.0/255.255.255.0
#   192.168.1.0/24
#
MulticastNetwork 192.168.1.0/24

# An interface address through which UDP multicast packets will be sent and
# received.
# Examples:
#   192.168.1.1
#
#MulticastIf 192.168.1.1
